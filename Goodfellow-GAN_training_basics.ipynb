    "- Analogy:\n",
    "    - Generative model: Team of counterfeiters trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection\n",
    "    - Discriminative model: Police trying to detect the counterfeit currency\n",
    "- Both the generator G and the discriminator D are composed of Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "- The generator $G$ takes as input a fixed-dimensional noise vector $z$, usually sampled from a Gaussian, and tries to transform it into images $G(z)$ that are indistinguishable from the original data ($x \\sim p_{data}$) while the discriminator's output $D(x)$ represents the probability that the sample $x$ comes from $p_{data}$\n",
    "- i.e. $D$ and $G$ play the **two-player minimax game** with the value function $V(G, D)$\n",
    "$$ \\min_G \\max_D V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{data}(x)} [ \\log D(x)] +  \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_{z}(z)} [\\log(1-D(G(z)))]$$\n",
    "- The authors also derive closed form expressions (in the function space) for the optimal discriminator $D^*$ (given any generator $G$) and show that there is a unique solution that ensures convergence "
